## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I encountered a challenge of the content overflowing on mobile devices, this forced me to revisit the Flexbox topic. Also l realised why it is important to develop for mobile devices first before developing/ designing for larger screens.


### Continued development

Adhering to best practices like developing for mobile devices is still a challenge
Knowledge gaps in the use of media queries for resposniveness

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox#the_flex_container) - This resource was helpful in fundamental information about Flexbox
